Stemming and Lemmatization 
-------------------------------------
Stemming and Lemmatization are text (word) normalization techniques 
in the field of Natural Language Processing that are used to prepare 
text, words, and documents for further processing. 

In grammar, inflection is the modification of a word to express 
different grammatical categories such as tense, case, voice, aspect, 
person, number, gender, and mood. 

The inflected word(s) will have a common root form. 
Example:
Eating, Eats, Ate ---> eat

Stemming and Lemmatization helps us to achieve the root forms of words.

Stemming is different to Lemmatization in the approach it uses to 
produce root forms of words and the word produced.

Stemming 
-------------
Stemming is the process of reducing inflection in words to their root 
forms such as mapping a group of words to the same stem even if the 
stem itself is not a valid word in the Language.
A subroutine that stems word may be called a stemming algorithm, or stemmer.
Example:
PorterStemmer, SnowballStemmer or LancasterStemmer.


Lemmatization 
-----------------
Lemmatization reduces the inflected words properly ensuring that the 
root word belongs to the language. 
In Lemmatization root word is called Lemma. 
A lemma is the canonical form, dictionary form, or citation form of a set of words.
Python NLTK provides WordNet Lemmatizer that uses the WordNet Database 
to lookup lemmas of words.


nltk
-----
Natural Language Tool Kit (NLTK) is a Python library to make programs 
that work with natural language. It provides a user-friendly interface 
to datasets that are over 50 corpora and lexical resources such as 
WordNet Word repository. The library can perform different operations 
such as tokenizing, stemming, classification, parsing, tagging, and 
semantic reasoning.
